    "summary": "The rationale for the TPA, and the crucial role technology plays in enabling such an approach",
    "full_text": "Large investment managers are increasingly looking to manage their entire investment portfolios with a total portfolio approach (TPA). Oliver Johnson, chief revenue officer at SimCorp, explains the rationale for the trend and the crucial role technology plays in enabling such an approach. To what extent has the TPA model gained traction across the buy side and, typically, what types of buy-side firms have adopted the approach? Oliver Johnson, SimCorp: In nearly every conversation we have with asset ownerspension funds, sovereign funds or insurance companieswe end up talking about TPA. However, its not the same on the asset manager side. While TPA has been part of the conversation weve had with asset owners for quite some time, Id say its only now starting to become relevant for some of the larger global asset managers, because theyre looking to create more multi-asset strategies that span different asset classes and products. What weve seen across our client base is that adoption largely tracks operational maturity. Institutions with established data infrastructure and cross-functional governance structures progress faster than those still operating in asset class silos. What is driving this shift to TPA among asset owners? Are they looking for greater diversification and exposure to new markets and asset classes?Oliver Johnson: Thats a common misconception. Asset owners have been in private markets and alternatives for years. The shift to TPA is about optimizing across these asset classes. Theyve moved beyond the diversification phase and are now focused on how their entire portfolios work together to meet liquidity needs, risk allocations and return objectives. Traditionally, firms had separate teams for fixed income, equities and private markets, each running strategies against their own benchmarks. TPA changes that by evaluating all investments together within a unified framework, eliminating silos that create inefficiencies and blind spots. Its about extracting more value from existing allocations, not simply adding new ones. What are the technology and operational components firms need to have in place to develop a viable, coherent TPA? Oliver Johnson: To run your firm on a TPA, you have to rely on a robust technology infrastructure. You need to be able to manage all of your asset classes holistically, and you need a single source of truth that supports all the automated processes across the different asset classes. At the heart of this is SimCorps investment book of record (IBOR). It is ultimately the foundation that allows portfolio managers to see all of their asset classes in real time. The tech stack is critical, especially from a risk and liquidity management perspective, as portfolios become more complex with increased private market allocations. Real-time exposure visibility across all asset classes is now table stakes. The IBOR has been core to SimCorps DNA for more than 25 years. What was the original vision behind that? Oliver Johnson: That was the foundational decision at SimCorps inceptionto model every asset class natively from the ground up in the IBOR. That means all asset classes exist in the same book of record, a foundation that makes TPA possible. The alternative approachmultiple fragmented systems with a data warehouse layered on toponly brings positions together on an end-of-day basis for consolidated reporting. We call that a total portfolio glance. You cant perform risk, performance or compliance in real time with end-of-day data. For investment decisions throughout the day, you need a real-time view across all asset classes. How does SimCorp help clients transition from legacy systems to a unified platform that enables TPA? Oliver Johnson: Another misconception about TPA is that theres only one path to implementation. In reality, the approach depends entirely on each institutions operational readiness, risk tolerance and strategic priorities. We see two main approaches. For example, one large pension fund recently came to us with multiple systems and initially asked us to layer on top of its existing infrastructure. Through our workshops, they realized they needed to fix the problem at the source by capturing transactions in an integrated platform rather than reconciling outputs. The fund replaced its equity, fixed income, private markets and derivatives systems with SimCorp One in a comprehensive migration. Other clients prefer a phased approach. They often start with private markets, which typically has the weakest infrastructure, then migrate equities and fixed income once that first implementation is live. The industry agrees on the end-goal: an integrated front-to-back system supporting all asset classes. The question is whether to replace everything at once or migrate in phases. Industry consensus is clear: the foundation for TPA is an integrated front-to-back system supporting all asset classes. What varies is the path to get therecomprehensive replacement versus phased implementation. Time-to-market with new implementations is increasingly driving buy-side technology decisions. Firms want quick wins with phased deployments so that parts of the business can be up and running with at least some new functionality and minimal lag. Is that correct? Oliver Johnson: Absolutely. Were currently working with one of the industrys largest asset managers that chose a hybrid approach, which entailed implementing the IBOR across all asset classes first, as this is at the heart of everything, and then integrating it with its existing systems and decommissioning those systems over time. This gives the asset manager the unified data foundation immediately while managing organizational change incrementally. What differentiates SimCorps approach to IBOR and TPA from other providers in this space? Oliver Johnson: What sets SimCorp apart starts with how we define IBOR, as the term has become diluted in the market. Our definition is precise: a single source of truth for all public and private markets investments that updates in real time, not start-of-day positions, but an immediate reflection of every trade, corporate action and cash movement. That foundation defines our three core differentiators. First is our native multi-asset capability. We built every asset class from the ground up within the same platform. This isnt bolt-on functionality or acquired systems stitched togetherits integrated by design, which is essential when institutions need a unified view across their entire portfolios. Second is open architecture with more than 160 partners. SimCorp delivers the IBOR core and handles integration complexity, although clients can access specialized functionality where they need it. Axioma is a good example of this. When SimCorp and Axioma merged, we integrated what was already the markets leading risk management solution and portfolio optimizer, rather than building our own. And third is our proven enterprise delivery. Large institutions choose us for our 50-year track record of successful implementations at the most complex organizations worldwide. When youre replacing mission-critical infrastructure across multiple asset classes, execution risk matters as much as capability. Sponsored content Copyright Infopro Digital Limited.

It participated in Code Crunch to test BQuants viability for developing custom applications. Waters Wavelength Ep. 341: Citis Pitts and Topa This weeks podcast guests are Citi Investor Services Michele Pitts, managing director and global product head of transaction management; and Marcello Topa, director for global market advocacy, policy, and strategy, who join Wei-Shen Wong to talk about UK and EU T1 settlement. CME, LSEG align on market data licensing in GenAI era The two major exchanges say they are licensing the use case, and not the technology, as the new era of GenAI creates unpredictability for market data managers about new licensing costs. This is critically important to both exchanges as market data fees and licensing costs have always been a point of contention with end-user firms, who see price increases nearly every year. For example, if a firm uses machine learning to manipulate transcript data of earnings calls, analyst briefings, and corporate presentations that they license from an exchange, data vendors dont license that data differently just because the firm uses machine learning. AI might be enabling new use cases, but automation, machine learning, and natural language processing have all been available for a decadewhy is generative AI any different? Its really just all of that on steroids, says Debbie Lawrence, group head of data strategy and management at LSEG. Chicago datacenter outage forced clearers to turn away clients An outage at a Chicago datacenter run by CyrusOne last week caused banks to turn away client trading and clearing business. Issues with a cooling system forced CME to take offline platforms used for its equity, foreign exchange, bond and commodity markets, and individual financial institutions with co-located servers were left in the same position. The incident has increased concerns about a risky combination of aging technology and the lack of substitutes if a large central counterparty (CCP) experiences an outage. An executive at one dealer, which had co-located servers for trading, says it had to suspend customer operations and take our servers offline until temperatures normalized to avoid causing damage. Tokenized assets draw interest, but regulation lags behind The US, EU, and the UK have shifted toward more blockchain-friendly messaging as the technology resurges. In the US, legal experts say the excitement about tokenization reflects financial firms recognition of blockchains potential, and an upcoming bill is expected to clear up confusion around classification of tokenized securities. But in Europe, the issue is more complex. The EU does not regulate tokenization through a single, centralized authority; instead, it allows its 27 member states to interpret EU laws within their own legal frameworks. Market readiness, infrastructure development, and overall technological maturity vary wildly between countries. TCB DataBroadhead pairing highlights challenges of market data management In the latest Waters Wrap, Anthony Malakian looks at the recent release of TCBs new market data administration platform, powered by Broadheads Digital Rights for Data Management, a distributed-ledger technology (DLT)-based digital contracts engine. The vendors hope that combining TCBs established reporting infrastructure with DRDMs digital contract and auditing technology will help users with market data rights management. However, skepticism of blockchains suitability for this remains, and rightfully so, Tony writes.

Scientology-Linked Startup Dream Exchange Loses Bid for SEC License, The Wall Street Journal The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected Dream Exchanges application for a license to run a stock exchange two months after The Wall Street Journal reported on the start-ups undisclosed financial ties to the Church of Scientology. The SEC said its decision was based on non-public information from an investigation into potential securities-law violations, as well as press reports raising questions about the potential misuse of funds. Dream Exchange is a Chicago-based startup that is seeking to become the USs first majority Black-owned stock exchange. It also seeks to establish itself as a venture exchange to list and trade small to mid-sized, early-stage company stock. In an order posted by the SEC, the regulator said although it hasnt made any determinations in connection with the investigation, the information currently before the Commission raises questions about DreamExs capacity to operate as a stock exchange. On Monday, Dream Exchange announced that it will promptly refile its application to register as a national securities exchange following the order denying its current Form 1 application.

FCA proposes equity CT to bolster UKs competitiveness The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has launched a consultation on proposals to introduce a UK equity consolidated tape to help increase capital investment and liquidity in equity markets. The new framework aims to improve market effectiveness by providing a view of trading volumes and prices across UK venues, support UK listings by giving firms and investors a more complete picture of liquidity, and increase participation in UK markets by ensuring easy and affordable access to market data. The consultation is seeking feedback on introducing a tape that includes both post-trade data and the attributed best-bid-and-offer prices (the first level of pre-trade data) across UK trading venues. The equity tape aims to be operational in 2027. After two years of operation, the FCA will review the frameworks effectiveness, including whether pre-trade data levels should be varied. Pisces operator approved by FCA in push for growth The FCA has approved JP Jenkins to operate a Pisces platform, a new type of private stock market that aims to connect buyers and sellers to trade shares in private companies on an intermittent basis. The FCA provides pre-application and application support services for all potential Pisces operators. So far, the regulator has issued two approvals, with the first being the London Stock Exchange.

According to our survey, which is still open, roughly half of banks use AI and machine learning to spot data quality issues. But most issues, about 75, are remediated without the help of emerging technologies.

Technology alone is not enough for Europes T1 push With Europe moving to T1 settlement in two years, the pressure is on to improve operational efficiency. Technologies like AI and automation can offer some relief, but cant do it all. Trade associations such as ISITC are looking at the lessons learned from the T1 transition in the US to aid the October 2027 switchover. Stakeholders across the industry agree that more focus and communication around the back office can serve as a major lift. FCA files to lift UK bond tape suspension, says legal claims without merit This week, the Financial Conduct Authority filed an application with the UKs High Court to lift the suspension placed on the bond tape process, which came after London-based fintech Ediphy contested the regulators decision to award the tape contract to rival Etrading Software. We welcome the FCAs application to lift the automatic suspension. The application is a strong signal to market participants to continue their preparations for the launch of the UK tape, while the legal challenge proceeds in parallel, says Sassan Danesh, CEO of Etrading Software. Ediphys complaints include an alleged conflict of interest at the FCA and a belief that the fundamental mechanism of the tender process, which was run as a reverse auction, was flawed. Ediphy is the leading member of consortium FairCT, which lost the UK race but was awarded the contract for the EUs version of a fixed income consolidated tape in July. FairCT is backed by FactSet, Google Cloud, Norges Bank Investment Management, TP Icap, and UBS. Chicago exchange group Cboe Global Markets dropped its involvement in the initiative before Ediphy filed its case, according to a person familiar with the matter. Waters Wavelength Ep. 339: Northern Trust Asset Managements Jan Rohof This week, Jan Rohof from Northern Trust Asset Management joins the podcast to discuss how asset managers and quants can get more context from data. Jump Trading spinoff Pyth enters institutional market data After launching in 2021, Pyth Network is now looking to compete more directly with institutional market data providers. In September, the peer-to-peer network launched Pyth Pro, a subscription service for market data across crypto, equities, fixed income, commodities and foreign exchange. It comes at a time when traditional firms are increasingly tiptoeing toward decentralized technologies such as asset tokenization, which has lately received frenzied attention from the worlds largest names in financial services. Pyths model gathers market data directly from exchanges, data vendors and trading firms, aggregates it under the applicable symbols, and makes it available on-chain. Publishers include familiar names Jump, Jane Street, Susquehanna, IEX, MEMX, Two Sigma, and Cboe Global Markets, while crypto publishers include Kaiko, LMAX, OKX, Talos, and Binance. Buy-side data heads push being on right side of GenAI At a Bloomberg event in London this week, tech executives from Man Group and Systematica Investments outlined the areas where generative AI is serving their firms best. Gr\u00e9goire Dooms, head of data research and development at Systematica Investments, said advancements in GenAI were proceeding incredibly quickly, and had significantly changed the way the firm interacted with unstructured datasets. Dooms explained that the technology had lowered the bar to accessing and processing unstructured textual data. Tushara Fernando, head of data and machine learning at Man Group, said GenAI was the biggest thing since the internet and was fundamentally changing how processes were thought about and optimized at the hedge fund. AI enthusiasts are running before they can walk There is something about flashy new technology that makes some users want to run before they can walk. AI is proving to be no exception. In this weeks IMD Wrap, Wei-Shen lays out what is tripping organizations up when it comes to utilizing the technology. Spoiler alert: its nothing new. Prediction Markets to Rival Stocks Within Years, Kalshi CEO Says, Bloomberg At the Futures Industry Association Expo conference in Chicago this week, Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour said the rapid growth in prediction markets this year has put the emerging market on track to overtake the stock market. Obviously, Mansour has an agenda to push as he angles for his platform to lead that market. But I wouldnt be surprised if competitors like Polymarket agree with that sentiment. If you follow the money, I dont think its a bad bet. Intercontinental Exchange announced a strategic investment in Polymarket last month to the tune of 2 billion. The investment includes Ice becoming a global distributor of Polymarkets event-driven data and providing customers with sentiment indicators on topics of market relevance. Additionally, Ice and Polymarket have agreed to partner on future tokenization initiatives. Kalshi has already inked a partnership with Robinhood Markets in a push to get its event contracts in front of more eyes. And more traditional names like CME are also creeping in. Last week, the derivatives exchange group announced a deal with online gaming giant FanDuel to launch prediction markets through the new FanDuel Predicts app, slated to go live next month.

Tradeweb advances swaptions electronification via new protocol Tradeweb Markets has completed the first fully electronic request-for-market (RFM) swaption package trade. Citadel and Barclays were counterparties on the trade, which was executed recently on the Tradeweb Swap Execution Facility (TW SEF). The execution of this trade enables institutional clients on TW SEF to request and receive a two-way market, rather than a price based on one direction, for a series of swaptions and swaps in a single electronic quote. This is especially beneficial for derivatives market participants, as it enhances transparency while simultaneously protecting client intent, and shares potentially sensitive or strategically valuable trading information exclusively between counterparties.

Experts urge banks to prep for quantums reckoning Some industry experts and mathematicians peg Q-Day, the day that a large-enough and stable-enough quantum computer is able to break modern encryption methods, as only five years away. In this story, execs from Symphony, Protiviti, and cyber firm Lastwall urge banks to start preparing yesterday and stop kicking the can down the road. If they dont, all their precious, regulated secrets may become public domain. SIX, ViaNexus build market data platform to unite data consumers, producers European exchange operator SIX Group and ViaNexus, the new iteration of what was formerly IEX Cloud, are teaming up to build a market data distribution platform that, if successful, will give SIX more command over its data products and users some freedom from convoluted and restrictive licensing structures. The platform, projected to be released next year, will function as a data marketplace, with users able to purchase datasets by the slice and be immediately entitled to use it. The spirit of the project is encapsulated by a number of feel-good words: access, ease, agility, democratization. But make no mistake: its also, centrally, about control. TMXs CEO wonders if tokenization is a solution looking for a problem If it exists, make it a token. Tokenization has been a hot topicrivaling that of artificial intelligencein this years spate of Q3 earnings calls. But the CEO of Canadian exchange group TMX, John McKenzie, seemed to offer a somewhat contrarian perspective on his firms quarterly call with shareholders. Despite having initiated several pilot programs, McKenzie says the technology has appeared to be a solution looking for a problem, a sentiment not dissimilar to that which was said after the blockchain mania seen a few years ago. Our marketplaces are prepared, but the use case is still a question mark in terms of the value add, he said. MSCI CEO: Vendor feverishly infusing every aspect of MSCI with AI During its Q3 earnings call, CEO Henry Fernandez said that since the launch of OpenAIs ChatGPT three years ago, MSCI has feverishly been looking into and permeating every aspect of MSCI with AI. MSCI has spent the last nine months working on tools that can help investors understand the ins and outs of their funds, focusing on creditworthiness, market risk, valuations, and terms and conditions of underlying loans. It will next look to develop evaluated prices in private credit. Much of this work is underpinned by AI, which Fernandez called a godsend. Row breaks out over cause of FX settlement fails An unnamed European bank is claiming to have seen a 50 increase in the rate and size of foreign exchange settlement fails over the past year, which it blames on the move to T1 settlement in North America on May 28, 2024. But reps for industry groups GFMA and the UKs T1 Taskforce, as well as post-trade utility Osttra, are scratching their heads, having found that almost all their members have not reported anything similar. Thats not to say that no firms have experienced settlement problems, but there are other culprits to consider: rising volatility, market stress, and a greater need for precision, especially for those in certain time zones, like the US West Coast and Asia Pacific. DTCC revamps tech abilities following global reporting overhaul The Depository Trust  Clearing Corporations Repository  Derivatives Services (RDS) is leveraging new forms of technology to upgrade the process of trade reporting and its clients workflows. Michelle Hillery, managing director and head of RDS, sat down with WatersTechnology to detail the clearing houses early testing simulator, global standardization of critical data elements, and its new use of natural-language interfaces for error investigation and correction. OpenAI looks to replace the drudgery of junior bankers workloads, Bloomberg News Those who were here in 2022 may remember when our editor, Tony, in a Waters Wrap, warned fintechs that Big Tech firms were coming for their toys. The first domino fell in November 2021, when Google invested 1 billion into Chicago derivatives exchange group CME, which promised to migrate its entire tech stack to Google Cloud. Nasdaq went next, announcing a near-replica deal with Amazon Web Services that same month. The dominoes never really stopped falling. Well, its happening again. But this time, the next generation of Big Techthat is, the large language model (LLM) providersis coming for this industry. In this column alone, Anthropic, which released Claude for Financial Services in July, gets its paws on LSEG and Third Bridge. And in the Bloomberg story linked above, youll find that OpenAI, the father of ChatGPT, has hired 100 ex-investment bankers to train its AI to build financial models as part of a secretive project, code-named Mercury. Mercury participants include former employees of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley, and the project involves almost no human interaction. Instead, these contributors are paid 150hour to write prompts and build financial models for a range of transaction types. OpenAI has also granted the contractors early access to the AI its creating, which aims to replace entry-level tasks at investment banks. Seems quite grim, but also a little funny. This is the second time in less than five years that the industry that somehow believes itself to be a thriving and cutting-edge tech sector is getting got by the actual tech sector, while pretending to be best friends. Will sanity ever prevail? The mild-mannered Englishman who was the worlds most prolific ghost hunter, LitHub A Halloween Cooler wouldnt be complete without a ghost storymy favorite kind of story. In this excerpt from Ben Machells Chasing the Dark: A 140-Year Investigation of Paranormal Activity, Machell details some of the unexplainable cases investigated by Tony Cornell, a skeptical Cambridge man who studied telepathy, paranormal activity, and other areas of psychic research in the latter half of the 20th century. Ghost stories are found all over the world, in different flavors but with remarkably similar textures. They are a thread that runs through all stripes of geographies, religions, ethnicities, and time periods, and they reveal to us our anxieties and hopes. In fact, my hometown, a small dot in upstate New York, has its own White Lady, a common figure in folklore that usually appears as a woman in a long, white, flowing gown. We call her Widow Susan. I believe in ghosts, literally and figuratively. After all, what is a memory, if not a ghost?
