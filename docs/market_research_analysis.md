## 6. Gaps & Opportunities for RISKCORE

Based on this analysis, the following gaps present opportunities:

### Gap 1: No Unified Multi-Manager Risk View
**Problem:** Multi-manager funds struggle to aggregate risk across PMs using different systems.
**Evidence:** Articles mention "fragmented," "siloed," and "manual" approaches to firm-wide risk.
**RISKCORE Opportunity:** Universal data ingestion + real-time aggregation

### Gap 2: High Cost of Enterprise Solutions
**Problem:** Bloomberg/Aladdin/SimCorp are expensive and require full adoption.
**Evidence:** Vendor landscape shows concentration in expensive enterprise platforms.
**RISKCORE Opportunity:** Open-source, modular, pay-for-what-you-use model

### Gap 3: Slow Aggregation for Regulatory Reporting
**Problem:** Manual data gathering for Form PF, AIFMD, etc.
**Evidence:** "Regulation" is a top tag; DORA and reporting mentioned frequently.
**RISKCORE Opportunity:** Automated regulatory aggregation and reporting

### Gap 4: Lack of Natural Language Queries
**Problem:** Risk teams can't easily ask questions of their data.
**Evidence:** AI/GenAI trends heavily discussed but not applied to risk aggregation.
**RISKCORE Opportunity:** Claude-powered natural language risk queries

### Gap 5: Poor Cross-PM Netting Visibility
**Problem:** PMs unknowingly take offsetting positions.
**Evidence:** "Total portfolio approach" articles highlight this unmet need.
**RISKCORE Opportunity:** Real-time cross-PM netting and overlap detection

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Immediate (MVP Focus)
1. **Position aggregation API** - Ingest from any source
2. **Unified security master** - Map identifiers across systems
3. **Basic exposure views** - Sector, geography, asset class

### Near-term (Differentiation)
4. **Natural language queries** - "What's our net tech exposure?"
5. **Cross-PM overlap detection** - Alert on large offsetting positions
6. **Regulatory reporting templates** - Form PF, AIFMD

### Long-term (Moat)
7. **Real-time streaming** - Live position and risk updates
8. **What-if analysis** - Scenario modeling across portfolios
9. **Adapter marketplace** - Community-built integrations
